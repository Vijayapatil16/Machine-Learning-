Code that runs faster is just generally more convenient but when we begin looking at applied data science and AI models, we can see more material benefits. Here you will see how optimization, particularly hyperparameter optimization can benefit more than just speed.\n","\n","These exercises will demonstrate how to apply **the Intel® Extension for Scikit-learn*,** a seamless way to speed up your Scikit-learn application.
